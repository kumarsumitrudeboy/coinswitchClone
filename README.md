#colanbotes Website
This project is still under developement and UI is currently ready for desktop and large screen size while I am still working on developing UI for mobile. Site is functional with few features.

Colab.notes is a collaboration tool which focuses on personal, professional and enterprise productivity with document creation, co-authoring, sharing with appropriate permissions and managing a workspace similar to Slack and MS Teams but with more features for easy collaboration under one subscription. We also offer our cloud storage as default while integration is available for popular cloud storage locations like GDrive and OneDrive. A lite version of this app is available on Playstore (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.colabnotes.app). App features all notes and notebook options as describe with addition to checklists. These checklists can also be used for project tracking as it easily allows to assign a task to another individual and also create a subtask which can again be assigned to appropriate project member. While the project is currently in development all features are not available, but I expect to deliver it soon.
